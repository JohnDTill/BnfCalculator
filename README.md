# BnfCalculator

Qt app to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions. Now with the latest feature addition of arbitrary precision arithmetic, you can know what it means for a value to be over 9000!

![alt text](resources/Screenshot.jpg?raw=true "It's over 9000!")

This project started as a small exercise is parsing. The calculator accepts expressions of real numbers. Standard operators include addition '+', binary and left-unary subtraction '-', multiplication '\*', division '/', exponentiation '^', and grouping '(' -EXPR- ')'. Also supported are right-unary factorial '!', backwards division '\\', modulus '%', and absolute value '|' -EXPR- '|'. Coincidently the scalar norm also works: '||' -EXPR- '||'.

The second update takes a step towards basic symbolic computation with a rudimentary implementation of big-num arithmetic. Look out Wolfram Alpha!

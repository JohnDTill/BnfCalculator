This project is a small exercise is parsing. The calculator accepts expressions of real numbers. Standard operators include addition '+', binary and left-unary subtraction '-', multiplication '\*', division '/', exponentiation '^', and grouping '(' -EXPR- ')'. Also supported are right-unary factorial '!', backwards division '\\', modulus '%', and absolute value '|' -EXPR- '|'. Coincidently the scalar norm also works: '||' -EXPR- '||'.
